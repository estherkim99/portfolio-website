# Portfolio Website Generator
- Developed Oct 2020

## Demo
~Website published at [estherkim99.github.io](estherkim99.github.io) using GitHub Pages and API published at [estherkim99-portfolio-api.herokuapp.com](estherkim99-portfolio-api.herokuapp.com) with Heroku~

This project is no longer hosted due to server costs. The Github Pages link above [estherkim99.github.io](estherkim99.github.io) hosts a different version of my portfolio website though, so make sure to check that out!

## Inspiration and Purpose of this Project
As a student seeking for job opportunities in software engineering, I came to realize the importance of showcasing my work. However, those who may not be familiar with web development may have a hard time developing website or have to spend significant sum of money for website editor solutions.
Therefore, I decided to make a website generator template, with which you would only have to edit the contents using Django Admin and fill in other information like intros, announcements in a json file.

## Technology
This project consisted of two parts - 1. building the front-end interface, 2. building a Django-based API for editing contents to be uploaded on the resume website.
